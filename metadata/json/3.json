    "description": "Newton's Cradle - A physics phenomenon known as the conservation of momentum and conservation of energy is demonstrated here. The Torus shown in this piece symbolises OpenDAO as both the driver and vehicle of change for all participants within the ecosystem. By shifting and transmitting energy through to all parts of the DAO, we can maximise growth and momentum while preserving energy for key moments of high velocity wave action.\r\n\r\n* Project coordinator: [@TheGuild_NFT](https://twitter.com/TheGuild_NFT)\r\n* Visual artist: [@ShinjiAkhirah](https://twitter.com/ShinjiAkhirah)\r\n* Music artist: [@marcotic12](https://twitter.com/marcotic12)\r\n* Special thanks to Jetski: [@ledoluna](https://twitter.com/ledoluna)",
